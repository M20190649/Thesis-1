\chapter{$k$-Sketch Query: Neighborhood Analytics in Sequence Data}

%Efficient $k$-Sketch Query Processing in Sequence Data: A Step Towards Computational Journalism}

%\section*{Preface}
%Sequence data are prevalently adopted in modeling time-ordered events, such as sports games and stock prices. In sequence data analysis, subjects which are the owners of the sequence events are often of the interest, such sport players and stocks. 
%There are two hireachical dimensions when defining neighborhood functions. First, at the event level, an event's neighborhood 
%
%
%A prominent neighborhood function used in literature is the \emph{streak} which is the consecutive events of a subject such as consecutive 10 games a player participated. A streak can be viewed as the \emph{distance} neighborhood. In this chapter, we propose a two-level neighborhood referred to as \emph{ranked-streak}.

%For a series of events, a prominent neighborhood adopted in literature is the \emph{streak}, which is generated by combining temporal nearby events. We observe that in the real application, streaks may be overwhelming to analyze. Therefore, we propose a selection methods that only choose the best streaks, which are referred to as \emph{ranked-streak}. The ranked-streak is the formed by a comparison neighborhood function which groups streaks with the same length together. We formally model the streak selection problem as a $k$-Sketch query, and we study the usefulness of such a query in the emerging computational journalism.
