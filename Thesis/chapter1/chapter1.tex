\chapter{Introduction}
With the maturity of database technologies, nowadays
applications collect data in all domains at an
unprecedented scale. For example, billions of 
social network users and their activities are collected in the form
of \emph{graphs}; Thousand sensor reports are collected per second
in the form of \emph{time series}; Hundreds of millions of temporal-locations
are collected as \emph{trajectories}, to name just a few. Flooded by the
tremendous amount of data, it is emerging to 
provide useful and efficient analytics for various data domains.
Traditional SQL analytics which comprises 
of operations (such as, partition, sorting and aggregation) in the relational domain
become limited in non-structured domains.
In SQL context, interesting analytics such as graph traversal and pattern detection
often involve complex joins which are very hard to optimize 
without domain knowledge.
In this thesis, we explore the neighborhood data analytic, which
in SQL is expressed by the window function,
on different domains and demonstrate how to efficiently deploy
neighborhood analytic to gain useful insights.

\section{Thesis Organization}
The remaining part of the thesis are organized as follows: in Chapter 2, we summarize related literature on neighborhood related analytics in different data domains. In Chapter 3, we present the window function on graph data. In Chapter 4, we present a news discovery application on time series data.
In Chapter 5, we present a pattern mining framework on trajectory data. Chapter 6 summarizes this thesis and highlights the future directions.
