\section{Scope of the Thesis}
In this thesis, we explore the neighborhood analytics in
different data domains. Our efforts showcase the usefulness of the neighborhood
concepts in those domains and address the efficiency issues when adopting
nontrivial analytics. In particular, we looked at three most prevalent data domains, namely \textbf{attributed graph},
\textbf{time series} and \textbf{trajectory}. 
We then categorize two intuitive neighborhood functions as follows:

\textbf{Distance Neighborhood}: the neighborhood is defined based on numeric distance, that is $\mathcal{N}(o_i,K) = \{o_j | \mathtt{dist}(o_i,o_j) \leq K \}$, where $\mathtt{dist}$ is a distance function and $K$ is a distance threshold.

\textbf{Comparison Neighborhood}: the neighborhood is defined based on the comparison of objects, that is $\mathcal{N}(o) = \{o_i | o.a_m \ \mathtt{cmp} \ o_i.a_m\}$, where $a_m$ is an attribute of object
and $\mathtt{cmp}$ is a binary comparator.


There could be other types of neighborhoods with more fine-grained or more general definitions. 
In this thesis, we demonstrate
that these two simple neighborhood definitions
joint with traditional analytic functions are already versatile 
in various domains. 
\revised{They are cable to both express existing queries and devise novel emerging 
queries that are practically useful.
