\section{Scope of the Thesis}
In this thesis, we explore the neighborhood analytics in
three prevalent data domains, namely \textbf{attributed graph},
\textbf{sequence data} and \textbf{trajectory}. 
Since the neighborhood analytics could be very broad,
this thesis only focus on the following 
two intuitive neighborhood functions:

\textbf{Distance Neighborhood}: the neighborhood is defined based on numeric distance, that is $\mathcal{N}(o_i,K) = \{o_j | \mathtt{dist}(o_i,o_j) \leq K \}$, where $\mathtt{dist}$ is a distance function and $K$ is a distance threshold.

\textbf{Comparison Neighborhood}: the neighborhood is defined based on the comparison of objects, that is $\mathcal{N}(o) = \{o_i | o.a_m \ \mathtt{cmp} \ o_i.a_m\}$, where $a_m$ is an attribute of object
and $\mathtt{cmp}$ is a binary comparator.

There could be other types of neighborhood functions with different level of granularity. 
However, despite the simpleness of these two neighborhood functions, they 
are indeed versatile in representing many useful analytics.

%In particular, we looked at three most prevalent data domains, namely \textbf{attributed graph},
%\textbf{time series} and \textbf{trajectory}. 
%We then categorize two intuitive neighborhood functions as follows:
%
%\textbf{Distance Neighborhood}: the neighborhood is defined based on numeric distance, that is $\mathcal{N}(o_i,K) = \{o_j | \mathtt{dist}(o_i,o_j) \leq K \}$, where $\mathtt{dist}$ is a distance function and $K$ is a distance threshold.
%
%\textbf{Comparison Neighborhood}: the neighborhood is defined based on the comparison of objects, that is $\mathcal{N}(o) = \{o_i | o.a_m \ \mathtt{cmp} \ o_i.a_m\}$, where $a_m$ is an attribute of object
%and $\mathtt{cmp}$ is a binary comparator.
%
%There could be other types of neighborhoods with more fine-grained or more general definitions. 
%In this thesis, we demonstrate
%that these two simple neighborhood definitions
%joint with traditional analytic functions are already versatile 
%in various domains. 
%\revised{They are cable to both express existing queries and devise novel emerging 
%queries that are practically useful.
