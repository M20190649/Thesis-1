\chapter{Graph Window Query: Neighborhood Analytics on Attributed Graphs}

%\section*{Preface}
%Nowadays, attributed graph are prevalently adopted to model
%linked data in many applications, such as social networks and biological networks.
%Besides the link structure, attributed graph also captures
%the attribute information of vertexes. In such a graph domain,
%vertexes are the objects of interest. Therefore, the natural definition of
%neighborhoods would base on the interconnections between the vertexes.
%In this chapter, we introduce the Graph Window Query, which encloses two neighborhood
%definitions. The $k$-hop neighborhood is a distance neighborhood, and the
%topological neighborhood is a comparison neighborhood. We first present the 
%semantic of these two window queries and then
%discuss how to 
%efficient process graph window queries in large-scale graphs.
