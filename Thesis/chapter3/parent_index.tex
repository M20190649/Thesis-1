\section{Inheritance Index}\label{gw:sec:topo}
\DBIndex\ is a general index that can support both $k$-hop as well as
topological window queries. 
%This is intuitive as the window matrix is able to cover both k-hop window or topological window. 
However, the evaluation of a topological window function (i.e., $W_t$)
can be further optimized due to its containment feature. 
In other words, the window of a descendant vertex 
completely covers that of one of its ancestors. 
This feature can be formally formulated in the following theorem. 

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:containment}
In a DAG, if vertex $u$ is the ancestor of vertex $v$, the topological window of $v$, $W_t(v)$ completely contains the window of $u$, $W_t(u)$, i.e., $W_t(u) \subset W_t(v)$.   
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
In a DAG, if $u$ is the ancestor of $v$, then $u \leadsto v$. $\forall w \in W_t(u)$, then $w \leadsto u$. As $u \leadsto v$, then $w \leadsto v$. Thus, $w \in W_t(v)$ and the theorem is proved.   
\end{proof}

Let us consider the BioPathway graph in Figure~\ref{fig:topological} as
an example.
Figure~\ref{fig:diff-index} (a) shows its abstract DAG. In (a), 
D is the ancestor of E. In addition, we can see that the window of $D$, 
$W_t(D)$ is $\{A, B, D\}$ and the window of $E$, $W_t(E)$ is $\{A, B, D, C, E\}$. It is easy to see that $W_t(D) \subset W_t(E)$.

	\label{fig:diff-index}
\end{figure}

Now, Theorem~\ref{thm:containment} provides us with opportunities for reducing
the space and computation cost in processing topological window queries. 
First, since the window of a vertex $u$ contains
the window of its parent $v$, there is no need to maintain
the full set of nodes of window $u$. Instead, we only
need to maintain the difference between $W_t(u)$ and $W_t(v)$.
%First, since the set of nodes corresponding to the
%window of a vertex ($u$) is the superset of the nodes of its
%parent vertex ($v$) there is no need to maintain the full set of 
%vertices of the window at $u$. Instead, 
%we only need to maintain the difference between 
%$W_t(u)$ and $W_t(v)$. 
We note that in a DAG, it is possible for $u$ to have
multiple parents, $v_1, \cdots, v_k$. In this case, the parent
which has the smallest difference with $u$ can be used; where there
is a tie, it is arbitrarily broken.
We refer to this parent as the {\em closest} parent. For instance, in Figure~\ref{fig:diff-index} (a), instead of maintaining 
$\{A, B, D, C\}$ for $W_t(E)$, it can simply maintain the difference 
to $W_t(D)$ which is $\{C\}$. This is clearly more space efficient.

Second, using a similar logic, the aggregation
at a node $u$ can reuse the 
aggregated result of its closest parent, $v$.
Referring to our example, the aggregation result of $W_t(D)$ can be 
simply passed or inherited to $W_t(E)$ and further aggregated with the difference 
set ($\{C\}$) in $W_t(E)$ to generate the aggregate value for $W_t(E)$. 
Figure~\ref{fig:diff-index} (b) indicates the inheritance relationship that 
the values of the father can be inherited to the child in the tree. 

Based on our observation, we propose a new structure, called the \textbf{Inheritance Index}, 
$I$-$Index$, to support efficient processing of topological window queries. 
In I-Index, each vertex $v$ maintains two information. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The first information is the ID of the closest parent (say $u$) 
of $v$. We denote this as PID($v$).
\item The second information is the difference between 
$W_t(v)$ and $W_t(u)$. We denote this as WD($v$). 
\end{itemize}

With PID($v$), we can retrieve $W_t(u)$, and combine with 
WD($v$) to derive $W_t(v)$. 
Likewise, we can retrieve the aggregated result of $u$ 
which can be reused to aggregate $v$'s window.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:diff-index}(c) shows the I-index of our example
in Figure~\ref{fig:diff-index}(a). In the figure, I-Index
is represented in a table format; 
the second column is the PID and the third indicates the WD. 

\subsection{Index Construction} 
Building an I-Index for a DAG
can be done efficiently. 
This is because the containment relationship can be easily 
discovered in a topological scan.
Algorithm~\ref{algo:piconstruction} lists the pseudocode for 
index creation. 
The scheme iterates through all the vertexes in a topological order.
For vertex $v$, the processing involves two steps.
In the first step, we determine the closest parent
of $v$. This is done by comparing the cardinality of $v$'s parent windows,
and find the parent with largest cardinality. 
The corresponding PID is recorded in the \emph{PID} field of 
I-Index (Lines~\ref{algo:tp-step1-start}-\ref{algo:tp-step1-stop}). 
In the second step, the window of $v$, $W_t(v)$, is pushed to 
its children (Lines~\ref{algo:tp-step2-start}-\ref{algo:tp-step2-stop}). 
When the processing of $v$ finishes, its window can be discarded. This
frees up the memory, which makes the scheme space efficient.

We note that the complexity of Algorithm~\ref{algo:piconstruction} is non-trivial to analyze. 
This is due to the difficulty of analyzing of the number of ancestors of each vertex. Suppose the 
average number of ancestors for each vertex is $H$, then Algorithm~\ref{algo:piconstruction} is of
complexity $O(H|V|*d)$, where $d$ is the average degree of the graph. This complexity is close to the
output complexity. That is to gather the all vertex-window mapping, at least $O(H|V|)$ elements needs
to be outputted. Thus the index construction complexity is reasonably efficient.

We further note that the size of \emph{I-Index} is hard to be precisely analyzed. 
This is due to the difficulty of analyzing the window differences.
Assume the average size of window difference
is $D$, then the size of \emph{I-Index} is $O(D|V|)$. Although $D$ can be as large as $O(|V|)$, our 
experimental results indicate that the index size is always 
comparable to the graph size. Furthermore, it is possible to
reduce the index size (should it be a concern) by employing
compression techniques.

\end{algorithmic}

\end{algorithm}

%In our experiments, we have evaluated various datasets. 
%The experimental results indicate that the index size is always 
%comparable to the graph size. We defer this discussion to 
%section \ref{sec:experiments}. Furthermore, it is possible to
%reduce the index size (should it be a concern) by employing
%compression techniques. 


\subsection{Query Processing with I-Index}
By employing the I-Index, window aggregation can be processed efficiently 
for each vertex according to 
the topological order. Algorithm \ref{alg:dstw-index} 
provides the pseudocode for the query processing. 
Each vertex $v$'s window aggregation can be calculated 
as 
%by using the following formula: 
%\begin{equation}
$\Sigma (W_t(v)) = \Sigma (v.PID,\Sigma(v.WD))$
%\end{equation}
, where $\Sigma$ is the aggregate function\footnote{For the function average, we need to keep both count and sum}. As the vertex is 
processed according to the topological order, $W_t(v.PID)$ 
would have already been calculated while processing $v$'s parent and 
thus can be directly used for $v$ without any re-computation. 
In general, $v$'s window aggregation is achieved by reusing its 
parent's aggregated result and corresponding window differences.
This avoids repeated aggregation and achieves 
computation sharing between a vertex and its parent. 
As a result, the computation overhead is largely reduced. 
Take the index  provided in Figure~\ref{fig:diff-index} (c) as an example, 
assume the query wants to calculate the sum. As a comparison, the number of add operations 
are $33, 22, 16$ for the cases without any index, 
with DBIndex and with I-Index index respectively. 


\begin{algorithm}
\caption{QueryProcessingOverIIndex}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require Input graph $G$, aggregate function $\Sigma$, inheritance index $IIndex$ 
%\Ensure $w$ \Comment{The aggregation result of each vertex}
\State $w \leftarrow ()$
\ForAll{$v \in$ topological order} \label{code:dstw-index-tp1}
	\State $u \leftarrow IIndex[v].PID$
	\State $WD \leftarrow IIndex[w].WD$
	\State $S \leftarrow v.val$
	\State $S \leftarrow \Sigma(S, w[u])$
	\ForAll{$t \in WD$ } \label{code:dstw-index-tp2}
		\State $S\leftarrow \Sigma(S, t.val)$
	\EndFor
	\State $w[v] \leftarrow S$
\EndFor \\
\Return $w$
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:dstw-index}
\end{algorithm}

As the query processing in Algorithm~\ref{alg:dstw-index} basically scans the \emph{I-Index}, the query
complexity essentially correlates to the index size. As we shown in the experiment session, the query can be performed efficiently 
in various graph conditions. 
%We defer the discussion to Section 6.


%\subsection{Handling Updates}
%%\remark{
%%Similar to DBIndex, attribute updates on I-Index is easy, since I-Index is built on the structure of the graph.
%%The general idea for handling structural updates is to identify the region that affected by the structure updates. Because adding or deleting an isolated node is trivial, the core part of structure update is adding/deleting edges. We observe that the region that affected by inserting/deletion edge $e(u,v)$ can be bounded by the subgraph between \emph{Lowest Common Ancestor} of $u,v$ and $v$. Since we do not focus on dynamic graph, we omit the detail here. Interested user may refer to the extended report of this paper \cite{}.}
%%\eat{
%We cover the updates handling in this section. For attribute updates, \emph{I-Index} is not affected since \emph{I-Index} is only structure related. Structure updates on \emph{I-Index} consists of node updates and edge updates. It is easy to handle the case where an isolated node is added or delete, since it does not affect any other nodes in the graph. Adding (resp. deleting) a node with edges can be done via edge insertions (resp. deletions). Here we focus on describing single edge insertion and deletion. We use $I$ to denote the \emph{I-index} and $I(v)$ to denote the index entry of $v$. 
%
%During an update of edge $e(s,t)$, there are two types of vertices are affected. The first type contains single node $t$, which is the endpoint of edge $e$. The second type of nodes contains all the descendants of $t$. There are altogether four special cases needs to be consider during the updates. We illustrate the four cases with aids of Figure~\ref{fig:dag_update}. In Figure~\ref{fig:dag_update}, the dashed edge $e(s,t)$ is the edge to be updated (added or deleted). The node $u$ is the \emph{lowest common ancestor}(LCA) of $t$ and $s$. The cloud shape $A$ and $B$ are nodes in between of $u,s$ and $u,t$. Since $u$ is the \emph{LCA}, $A$ and $B$ are thus disjoint. Bold edge $e(c,d)$ indicate that $I(d).PID$ is $c$. We distinguish and handle the four cases as follows:
%
%\textbf{Case I ($I(t).PID = s$)}: As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dag_update} (a), during deletion, $t$ needs to choose a parent from $A$ to be its $I(t).PID$. $I(t).WD$ needs to be updated accordingly. In this case, no insertion needs to be considered since if there is no edge between $s$ and $t$, $I(t).PID$ cannot be $s$. 
%
%\textbf{Case II ($I(t).PID \neq s$)}: As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dag_update} (b), during insertion, $B$ needs to be excluded from $I(t).WD$. During deletion, any node in $B$ that cannot reach $t$ needs to be included in $I(t).WD$. Since $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, every node in $B$ needs to be removed from $I(t).WD$
%
%\textbf{Case III ($t \leadsto I(v).PID$)}: As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dag_update} (c), during insertion, any node in $B$ needs to be removed from $I(v).WD$. During deletion, any node in $B$ that reaches $v$ but cannot reach $a$ needs to be added to $I(v).WD$.
%
%\textbf{Case IV ($t \nrightarrow I(v).PID$)}: As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dag_update} (d), during insertion, any node in $B$ that cannot reach $r$ needs to be included into $I(v).WD$. During deletion, any node in $B$ that cannot reach $v$ needs to be excluded from $I(v).WD$.
%
%During structure updates, essential operations are computing $A,B$ and performing reachability queries. Computing $A,B$ can be done via existing techniques such as \cite{bender2005lowest,czumaj2007faster} while reachability query can be supported by indexing methods such as \cite{yildirim2013dagger}. We defer exploring for more efficient updating algorithms to future work
