Our proposed neighborhood queries are inspired
by the usefulness of window functions in relational analytic queries~\cite{zemke2012s}.
A window function in SQL specifies a set of partitioning attributes 
$A$ and an aggregation function $f$.
Its evaluation first partitions the input records based on $A$ to compute 
$f$ for each partition, and each input record is then associated with the aggregate 
value corresponding to the partition that contains the record.
Several optimization techniques \cite{cao2012optimization, bellamkonda2013adaptive}
have also been developed to evaluate complex SQL queries 
involving multiple window functions.

However, the semantic and evaluation of the window function are restricted by the 
relational model. As been analyzed previously, SQL window functions require
tuples to be sorted in order to form individual windows. However such a need
is hard to meet in other data domains. Therefore, optimization techniques
that are developed for the relational model become inapplicable in other domains. 
Nevertheless, there are quite a few works that related to the neighborhood
queries that we have proposed and we summarize them in this section. 

%are very different between relational and graph contexts.
%Specifically, the partitions (i.e., subgraphs) associated with GWFs are not necessarily disjoint; thus,
%the evaluation techniques developed for relational context \cite{cao2012optimization, bellamkonda2013adaptive} are not applicable to GWFs. %\remark{\cite{bellamkonda2013adaptive} focuses on utilizing partition to parallel window processing, and \cite{cao2012optimization} focuses on leveraging sorting among windows. However sorting and partitioning are no longer exists in GWFS, thus, their work are not applicable}
