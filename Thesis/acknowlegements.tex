I would hereby express my gratitude to the people that have been ... without whom this thesis cannot be accomplished. 

My utmost gratitude goes to my main supervisor, Prof. Kian-Lee Tan, for his constant and painstaking efforts in inspiring me to explore
beyond the boundary of my research topic during my candidature. It has been a
remarkable experience to conduct research under Professor Tan's guidance. During
the time, he has shared much of his experience, knowledge and wisdom to me, which
will surely benefit every aspect of my life. Regarding to research, he has always taught
me to zoom in and zoom out when solving a particular problem, and this insight had
deep impact on my research. Prof. Tan also provided me with many opportunities to
stay in touch and collaborate with both local and global prestigious researchers which
were invaluable experiences and broadened my horizon. I would also like to sincerely
thank my TAC members, Prof. Anthony Tung, Prof Roger Zimmermann and Prof. Shuicheng Yan for the valuable guidance and support
during my Ph.D. study. 

I have been fortunate to work with these brilliant people
who are generous with their time and friendship. My special thanks also go to my dear fellow colleagues. Without them, I would not have had such a meaningful Ph.D. life.
Thank them for bringing me so many fond memories. I am also grateful to all the
other staffs, fellow colleagues and friends in the Robotics Research Lab, the Social
Robotics Lab and Advanced Robotics Center for their companionship, generous help
and collaborations.

I am also very grateful to National University of Singapore for providing me with a great opportunity and financial support to pursue my Ph.D. degree.

Last but not least, I wish to thank my family, especially my parents and parents in-law, providing me the freedom to pursue my dream. My preserved thanks always goes to my wife Sophia, who consistently stands by me and give priceless support.
